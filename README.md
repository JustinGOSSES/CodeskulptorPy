# CodeskulptorPy
A collection of games that run in Codeskulptor, which runs python in a browser window.</br>

If you want to run these scripts, the easiest way is to paste them wholesale into the left side window at this links - http://www.codeskulptor.org/ .</br>

Not all standard python modules are available in codeskulptor, so to run them as a normal python script you must replace the simplegui module with SimpleGUICS2Pygame as described on this webpage .https://simpleguics2pygame.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#

Live versions of several of these are available on my personal website:
